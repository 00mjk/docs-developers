# General

## Explanation
A __“Request for Comments” (RFC)__ is a lightweight process that embraces the oldest consensus tool on the Internet.

The three intents of the RFC process embody what we value in a transparent and collaborative developer team

* Anyone in the organization can propose an idea, regardless of length
* Proposals should be timely, not perfect
* These are non-authoritative, non-binding ideas

Through this process we will:

* foster knowledge and contributions
* enable individual contributors to make decisions for systems they’re responsible for
* allow domain experts to have input in decisions when they’re not directly involved in building a particular system
* manage the risk of decisions made
* help improve our documentation base through this snapshot
* will have more time to think about the problem than going to a meeting and being confronted with the ideas and having to argue
* be asynchronous
* work on multiple projects in parallel

Please refer to ["RFC1 "Using RFCs"](0001-using_rfcs.md) for a detailed explanation of why RFCs are important and how to contribute your own RFC to this series.

## Participation

Being an author makes it clear that you are the person who is responsible for the proposal. This is an explicit way of being empowered to take the lead without the need to be the loudest or most dominant member of a team.

Inclusion requires responsibility - if you want to be included, you must participate. Developers are not required to participate, but if they don’t do it in time, they lose the opportunity of being included.

> **Open Question:** What is the time limit for resolving an RFC? It could be a given time limit (suggestion: minimum one week, maximum three weeks) or a final meeting or up/down vote by x individuals. Whatever we decide, it should be consistent.

## Should I write an RFC for this?
Many software changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal git pull request workflow without ever touching this process. However, we do ask that bigger requests and ideas follow a bit of formality, especially when you are thinking about changes that impact other engineers elsewhere in the company. By creating an RFC, you're guaranteed that impacted folks have an adequate heads-up on the changes.

You should write an RFC if you:

* are building something from scratch. New endpoint, component, system, library, application, etc.
* the need rewrite has crossed your mind
* will impact more than one system or other team members.
* would like to define a contract or interface between clients or systems.
* are adding or replacing programming languages or tools to the stack

Some changes do not require an RFC:

* Rephrasing, reorganizing, refactoring, or otherwise "changing shape does not change meaning".
* Additions that strictly improve objective, numerical quality criteria
